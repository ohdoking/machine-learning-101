# Machine Learning Study

place : mlconference(https://mlconference.ai/)

To start the machine learning tutorial lauch Jupyter Notebook and open the release/1/index.ipnb file with the following command:
```ipython notebook release/1/index.ipnb```

You will need to have the following Python 3 packages installed:
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* sklearn
* pandas
* jupyter notebook

For convenience we advice to use the [Anaconda Python Package](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)


## JupyterHub (BETA)

If you want to host this workshop you can use the included Dockerfile to build a JupyterHub wich you can build and launch it with the following commands:

```docker build . -t ml-tutorial```

```docker run -p 8000:8000 ml-tutorial```

Surf to `http://localhost:8000` to start the tutorial and log in with `user001` and password `password`.

The docker image is also available on docker hub so running it might also work with:
```docker run -p 8000:8000 pbutenee/ml-tutorial```
without the need for downloading the code or building the container.

## STUDY

### Imports

In Python you need to import tools to be able to use them. In this workshop we will mainly use the numpy toolbox and you can import it like this:

``` python
import numpy as np
```
